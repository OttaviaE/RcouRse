This is a basic course on `R` and `shiny` for the Qhelp seminar, whih will be held in Padova (Italy) from July 9 to July 16, 2022. Further information on the Qhelp seminars and the Erasmus + program can be found [here](https://qhelp.eu/)

## `R`

`R` is one of the most used software for data analysis in Social Sciences. Since the best feature of `R` (besides being open source) is its community, you can find help from every part of the world online. You are never alone, and if you feel lost, you can just ask google to help you. 

Everyone can contribute with new packages, by signaling bugs in existing packages, opening issues in [GitHub](https://github.com/), suggesting new features, and so forth. 

## This course

This course aims at giving a brief yet comprehensive introduction to the use of `R` as a programming language. `R` can be used for developing web applications through `RStudio` and the `shiny` package. Some examples of shiny apps can be found [here](https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/). 

- IntRoduction: Using `R` for data analysis and programming [PDF](intRo/intRo.pdf)
- Shine bright like an open source app: Basics on how to program in `shiny` for developing interactive web applications [Rmd](shiny/shiny.Rmd) (Unfortunately, it is not possible to embed the interactive shiny apps in the HTML file. Nonetheless, [here](shiny/shiny.html) you can find the HTML slide, without the interactive apps)
