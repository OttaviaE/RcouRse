## `R`

`R` is one of the most used software for data analysis in Social Sciences. Since the best feature of `R` (besides being open source) is its community: You can find help from every part of the world. You are never alone, and if you feel lost, you can just ask. 

Everyone can contribute with new packages, by signaling bugs in existing packages, opening issues in [GitHub](https://github.com/), suggesting new features, and so forth. 

## This course

This course aims at gving a brief yet comprehensive introduction to the use of `R` as a programming language. `R` can be used for developing web application through `RStudio` and the `shiny` package. Some examples of shiny apps can be found [here](https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/).
